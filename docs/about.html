<p>Hi! I'm a 4th year mechanical engineering student at McMaster University with an interest in thermofluids, energy systems, mechanics and design, and sensors and instrumentation.</p>

<p>The purpose of this portfolio is to track my growth as an upcoming engineer and showcase my contributions to building a Formula SAE team as a lead, member and advisor. By documenting my thought process as close to real-time as possible, not only am I able to reflect on the engineering decisions I made and why, but future Formula SAE students can also benefit by being inspired by and learning from my experiences.</p>

<h2>2021: My Formula SAE Journey Begins</h2>
<p>My journey on <a href="https://macformularacing.com/">MAC Formula Electric</a> began in 2021 as an Aerodynamics and Cooling Member. With this being the team's transition year back to in-person activities due to COVID-19, I found myself becoming an integral part of the team's infrastructure and manufacturing personnel, executing and developing both composites and machining processes.</p>

<h2>2022: Keeping the Momentum Going</h2>
<p>With plenty of manufacturing and materials testing experience, I became the team's first Composites Manufacturing Lead in 2022. I continued to develop and refine the fundamental manufacturing and testing processes required to satisfy SAE requirements and produce vehicle components. A major highlight was successfully producing a carbon fiber monocoque for the first time since 2019!</p>

<h2>2023: Returning to Aerodynamics and Cooling</h2>
<p>With a more grounded, established team, I was able to return as the Aerodynamics and Cooling Lead in 2023. This year served as the team's return to aerodynamic design and production in 4 years, with an emphasis on making decisions informed by vehicle dynamics, cooling, and first-principles engineering. We wanted to engineer the workflows to continuously produce high performance aerodynamic and cooling devices year after year, and we did just that.</p>

<h2>2024: Co-op Intermission</h2>
<p>2024 marked my first time physically away from the team to pursue a co-op at the Johnson Electric Fluid Power Solutions branch in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. This marked my first step into internal flow CFD, performing multi-phase FSI simulations on a CDC (continuous damping control) valve to successfully develop a lumped-parameter Simulink model for rapid design analysis. On top of my efforts in the workplace, I was still able to make huge contributions to the team. This included setting up a sponsorship for a 64 core CFD workstation, writing a genetic algorithm for 2D multi-element optimization, writing a first-principles MATLAB script for radiator selection, as well as generally supporting team members in their own CAE and manufacturing tasks.</p>

<h2>2025: Passing the Baton</h2>
<p>In 2025, with thoughts of pursuing a masters, I return to MACFE as an advisor to better manage my time between school, Formula SAE, and personal endeavours. I continue to support any team members who require my advice and/or guidance with design, analysis, manufacturing, assembly, and testing.</p>
